                            On the homepage, the players have 3 possibilities:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Play the game</li>

                        <h1>Selection of the avater and the player</h1>

                            If the players click on the button <i>PLAY</i>, they will be redirected to the selection of the avatar and the player.
                            Both players can choose a different alias. The alias will serve to etablish the leaderboard. If an alias is already used, the new score will override the ancien one.
                            Their location is by default automatically provided by an API. However, they can correct it if they want.
                            Furthermore, they can choose between a set of avatars. They have just to drag and drop the wished one inside the dedicated field.

                            The game page is divided in 2 parts, one for each player. It includes the game field with the own view of the player and a board with the life points, the timers and some indications.
                            At the top, there is a <i>Pause</i> button.

                            If one of the player click on the <i>Pause</i> button, the game will be paused and a popup appears.
                            The players can decide either to continue the game, or to restart from beginning or to leave the game and go back to the homepage.
                            By the 2 last options, the current score gets lost.
