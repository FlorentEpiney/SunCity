                        <h3>Sun City</h3>
                        <p>
                            Welcome to <strong>Sun City</strong>, a 2-player survival game developed as part of the Web
                            development course at <a href="https://www.hevs.ch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer"><strong>HES-SO Valais</strong></a>.
                            Set in a post-apocalyptic version of the city Sierre, the game immerses you in a World
                            devastated by a virus outbreak.
                            With society in ruins and the law of the jungle prevailing, your only goal is to survive
                            against relentless waves of enemies.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Objective</h3>
                        <p>
                            The objective of <strong>Sun City</strong> is simple: survive for as long as possible.
                            A timer tracks each player's survival time, and the longer you stay alive, the more points you accumulate.
                            However, with time comes increasing difficultyâ€”more enemies appear, stamina decreases, and survival becomes harder.
                            The ultimate challenge is to outlast your opponent while staying alive in a harsh, enemy-filled environment.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Gameplay Overview</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Choose your avatar and enter the destroyed streets of Sierre.</li>
                            <li>Use your weapon to fight enemies and extend your survival time.</li>
                            <li>Collect health kits scattered around the map to recover lost life points.</li>
                            <li>The difficulty increases over time: more time = more enemies = higher challenge.</li>
                            <li>The match ends as soon as one of the two players dies.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Technology Stack</h3>
                        <p>Sun City is developed using core front-end web technologies:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>HTML</li>
                            <li>CSS</li>
                            <li>JavaScript</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Inspiration</h3>
                        <div>
                            Sun City takes cues from classic survival and action games, particularly:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Grand Theft Auto (GTA) - for its open-environment chaos and vibe</li>
                                <li>Doom - for the fast-paced combat and survival mechanics</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>Furthermore, the game is partly inspired from real life examples and events from the
                                development team members:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Sierre, the city where this game development has begun</li>
                            </ul>
                        </div>
